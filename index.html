       <p>
            CSCE 247 is a class instructed by Portia Plante with the mission of teaching students the process of being a software engineer. 
            This included learning different design patterns, understanding the software development cycle, and utilizing SCRUM. 
            For the semester project, my team was tasked with developing a fully functional DegreeWorks program with the overall goal of being user-friendly and allowing students 
            to monitor their degree progress. This project required my team to put in our best effort and go through
            the various steps of the software development cycle while also satisfying our stakeholders.
